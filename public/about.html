<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I’m Pasula Hari Chandan Reddy, a passionate and driven Computer Science graduate from TKR College of Engineering 
  and Technology (2021–2025). With a strong foundation in programming and a deep interest in software development, 
  I’ve equipped myself with skills in Python, Java, C, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Machine Learning. My academic journey 
  has been shaped by curiosity and a commitment to continuous learning, allowing me to take on both web and machine 
  learning projects confidently.</p>

<p>During my B.Tech, I developed a Hostel Booking Web Application, which simplifies the accommodation process for 
  students through a responsive and user-friendly interface. I also worked on a Machine Learning project to predict 
  employee promotions using data mining techniques, which helped me understand real-world data handling and model building. 
  These experiences sharpened my problem-solving mindset and taught me the value of writing clean, maintainable code.</p>

<p>Outside of academics, I’m deeply passionate about cricket, which has taught me discipline, teamwork, and focus—qualities 
  I bring to my professional life as well. I’m now looking forward to beginning my career as a software developer, where I 
  can contribute meaningfully to real-world products while constantly growing in both skill and experience.</p>
